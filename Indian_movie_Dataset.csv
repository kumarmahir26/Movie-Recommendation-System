Most of us lose focus and give up. We are most afraid to believe in our own dreams. Those who do are the true winners. This slice of life film is set in the backdrop of our capital city- Delhi. A city that brings in thousands of North Indians in search of opportunities that was never available in their own home towns. Like-wise, six boys from different states come together to share a two BHK apartment in a middle-class colony, which they lovingly call ""Sadda Adda"". This film is their story. It is about how six bachelors, with completely different backgrounds and personalities, live together. Their apartment ""Sadda Adda"" is a complete mess with empty beer bottles, cigarette butts, unwashed clothes, mattresses tossed all over the floor etc - yet together they cook food, clean, buy groceries, pay rent, laugh, cry, fight over insignificant issues and always stand up for each other - like a family. ""Sadda Adda"" which began as a transitional accommodation to help them work towards their dreams, becomes their home. The film takes us through a journey of their camaraderie and self-belief. The interwoven stories of these 6 characters takes us through a heart warming journey of the lives of these boys. This movie is about real characters from life who have fun, who fight the wave everyday and through very light heart moments inspire us in the most modest way. The crests and troughs that shape them into the men they will become in the future - because Boys will not always be boys.",Hindi

Bengaluru is home for thousands of startups and our little story follows the journey of three dreamy eyed middle class boys who venture into setting up their startup led by Suhas, a man who resembles Bengaluru's air of fresh zeal and endless hope. Suhas is on a pursuit to find investors for his startup that he thinks will disrupt the ecosystem and the story takes a new turn when he comes face to face with reality. Jammed in between dreams, desperation and a twist of fate, the sporty startup founder Suhas emerges out of this urban mess by discovering the motherly charm of the old city which he had taken for granted all the while. Our film has a variety of characters in Bengaluru - from venture capitalists to gangsters, cricket aficionados to crooks, founders with fancy airs to disheartened failures - our film has light moments, life lessons, inspiration, rootedness and most importantly, eternal hope.

Haaji Saheb finds a boy named Babruddin for Nafeesa. Babruddin used to travel to Mumbai and is mesmerised by the City Life. He feels she is not pretty. so refuses to take her to Mumbai Nafeesa is disheartened with the treatment of her husband. Before leaving to Mumbai. Babruddin succumbs to his physical urges and ends up abusing Nafeesa. she becomes pregnant. Nafeesa delivers a baby boy. Nafeesa is heart-broken when Babruddin doesn't come back to visit her or her son. Nafeesa receives a written TALAQ from Babruddin. Nafeesa's world is Shattered. Nafeesa dedicates her life for her son, Munna and declines a Marriage offers. Babruddin's father comes home to meet Munna, who is twelve years old now. Promising him an Opportunity to study and become a doctor. With this he lures away Munna from his mother Nafeesa. Nafeesa is devastated and Lonely again What happens to Nafeesa's future..?

Nafisa is a humble community young lady brought into the world in a Muslim family, who has dreams of a decent everyday life. At the point when she is hitched to a well-off kid who knows the enormous city life, her joyfully ever-after appears to be a long way from turning into a reality.

Saara Vajra is the transformation of a novel by essayist Saara Aboobacker, which exposes the situation of ladies in the families of unassuming community Karnataka, where they have limitations and their fantasies are much of the time just restricted to their psyches alone. This transformation by Aarna Saadya is a bit exaggerated, yet talks about numerous relevant issues that are tracked down in these homes and that should be tended to. The film manages the existence of Nafisa, a young lady who thinks she has tracked down the man of her fantasies, when she is hitched to a gorgeous, young fellow from a decent family. Be that as it may, her significant other, who has had a sample of city life, finds his yokel spouse frequently frightful and treats her with scorn. Then starts Nafisa's excursion, when she is compelled to get away from her family, including her child. Anu Prabhakar sparkles in a creator upheld job, where she particularly succeeds in her more established symbol. Sudha Belawadi and Ramesh Bhat give the much-required weightage to their jobs. Rehaman Hussain dazzles in his dim job. The film has a few decent clear lines of sight of inside Karnataka as well. What pulls it back is the treatment, where it frequently appears to be exaggerated and beyond absurd. While this adds to the profound allure, one feels that dealing it down a little would have made a difference. Watch this however, as it resolves many issues that should be spoken about and has a few decent exhibitions.

This a saga of a Muslim lady married to a male dominated man from Muslim at her very young age. Fighting for her rights, right to education, multiple marriage & fight against triple Triple Talaq is the interesting part of the story",Kannada

Gilli,2009,,4.2,12,"The movie begins with Girish (Gilli) (Gururaj) on his way to work. People stare at him and laugh behind his back as he travels to his office. He appears distracted throughout the day and even instructs his assistant to postpone an important meeting with a big client. He then waits for someone at Marina Beach with a bouquet of flowers. His best friend, Lakshmi sees him and asks him whom he is waiting for. Gilli explains he is waiting to meet his girlfriend, Arati (Rakul Preet Singh) for their date. In flashbacks, we are shown how Gilli first met Arati. Gilli belongs to a lower middle class family, living with his parents and younger sister in Rainbow Colony in Chennai. He is perceived as a good for nothing person as he skips classes, fails in exams, and gets involved in fights. Gilli believes that his father hates him and often quarrels with him, even threatening to leave the house, only to be persuaded not to do so by his mother. Gilli's life changes when a once well-to-do family moves into the same colony due to loss in business. Gilli is attracted to the daughter of his new neighbour, Arati. Although he tries to woo her, Arati treats him with disdain. One day, Gilli confesses to Arati that he loves her. He tells her that having always been ridiculed, he found respite in the fact that she at least bothered to look at him. He promises to wipe her thoughts out of his mind, as he is not right for her. Despite himself, Gilli continues pursuing her. Arati realizes that Gilli is not such a useless fellow when Lakshmi tells her that she has seen Gilli dismantle and assemble a motorcycle within minutes each time they steal a bike to get drunk. Arati takes Gilli to a Hero Honda dealer and asks them to give him a job. He is promised a job if he can assemble a bike. Initially, the lethargic Gilli is disinterested and gives up the task. Arati takes him to the washroom and slaps him before revealing that she has fallen in love with him. She then tells him that they can only be together if he gets a proper job and gets his life straightened out. Gilli then demonstrates his skill in motorcycle assembly, securing a good job with the dealer. Later that evening, Gilli plans a treat for his friends. However, Arati confronts him and makes him break the good news to his parents first to get their blessings. However, Gilli's father berates him as usual for getting a job instead of completing college. Then later at night, Gilli overhears his father telling his mother how proud he is of their son since getting a job at such a prestigious company, which is not easy. The only reason the father did not openly praise Gilli is because he feared his son might misjudge him for giving him respect, only now that he is earning money for their household. Only then does Gilli realize his father's love for him and weeps in joy. The intimacy between Gilli and Arati is discovered by her mother and she refuses to allow them to continue dating even as Gilli's father tries to persuade her otherwise. Arati's family is heavily indebted to another Northern Indian family that has been supporting them since Arati's father suffered losses in his business. Arati's parents want Arati to marry the son of the family that has helped them. Using her friend's marriage as a ruse and with unwitting help of her friend's aunt, Arati escapes her home and travels with Gilli to a tourist place near Thekkady in Kerala and they end up in a hotel room. Arati reveals that she has made the biggest decision of her life by deciding to make love to him, as he should not regret falling in love with her when she marries the man her parents chose. Though stunned by her decision, Gilli goes with her plan and the two consummate their love. The next morning Gilli and Arati argue when Gilli says he wants Arati to live with him, while Arati accuses him of being attracted to her only because of the sex. They continue arguing as they exit the hotel. While crossing the road, Arati is knocked down by a truck as a helpless Gilli watches. Gilli is also hit by a speeding vehicle. Arati dies gruesomely on the spot and Gilli is injured. Gilli is heavily shocked to find the mere remains of Arati in Hospital mortuary. Though the Police want to file a murder case on Gilli, Arati's mother refuses to name Gilli as a murderer. Gilli tells the Police that Arati never accepted his love, and her death was really an accident. This way, Gilli saves Arati's dignity and her mother blesses him as she leaves. After sadly returning to Chennai, Gilli tries to commit suicide only to be helped by a group of nuns. Gilli then hallucinates about Arati's spirit coming to him and advising him to live life to the fullest. Back in present day, it is revealed that Gilli has become very successful person in his life but has remained mentally damaged since Arati's death. He still believes that she is alive and always imagines talking to her. The film ends with Gilli talking to himself at the beach, thinking that he is talking to Arati.",Kannada

Amen promises a luxuriant plot replete with music, faith, fantasy and romance and an amazingly varied set of characters. As the parish seriously discusses whether to retain the church's band that had lost to the rival group in the earlier band competition, a young priest Fr. Vincent Vattoli (Indrajit) takes charge under Fr.Ottaplackan. He is stylish, dares to defy conventions and is in support of the romance between Solomon and Sosanna. His actions irk the senior priest and things take a serious turn after a while. The people agrees to a pact that sets the fate of Solomon's love with Sosanna, and the Kumarankary church band's future.

He soon becomes a trusted aide of Balaram and all is well for a while. However, Balaram catches Rahman while he is offering Namaz and asks him for an explanation. Out of desperation, Rahman reveals that he has a younger brother named Rahman. (He says the brother's name is Rahman since Balaram knows the original guy as Ram). This Rahman character is portrayed as a gay and Balaram tasks him with teaching his sister (Shazahn Padamsee) the art of dance. Rahman struggles to manage the roles of Ram and Rahman and a confusion drama ensues. As can be expected, the truth comes out in the end and Balaram is outraged.",Telgu

Cut to present day, Thulasi lands in Bangalore and manages to get a flat at the Clean and Green Apartments where his wife and little son now live. Soon, he manages to make friends with his adorable son, Harsha (Athulith), much to the annoyance of Vasu. From here, the plot gets a bit serious and we are told of a brain hemorrhage. Who suffers from it, is the twist in the tale though. Before one has the time jump to conclusions, the bad guys of yore make their entry once more and shoot Thulasi.

No living person knew how he came about this blessed village - but initially was shunned by both Hindus and Muslims, especially by Bal Bhate who though Sai was a Muslim and forbade him to enter any Mandir; Rohila, a Muslim, who thought Sai was desecrating the local Masjid by performing Hindu prayers and incantations, attempted to kill Sai, but then he saw both Allah and Bhagwan in Sai's eyes and became a devotee. When Sai was ready to give up his body and resurrect himself after 3 days, just like Lord Jesus, a disbelieving Bal had wanted Sai's body to be cremated within 24 hours - only to find out that Sai had indeed risen, and also became his devotee. As did Bhagoti, a leper, who was cured by Sai. Though Sai had no relations, he did call Tatya's mom his sister; Tatya his maternal nephew; a devotee named Laxmi as his daughter, and an elderly woman as his mother. Sai displayed his true form and opulence to another devotee, Nana Chandorkar. Though he lived in a rebuilt Masjid, Sai urged his devotees to pray to God, as the Creator had only created Humans - never any religion or borders - and to love and respect all living beings. He begged for alms daily so that he could collect sins and wash them away. He always uttered 'Allah Bala Kare' and 'Bhagwan Bala Kare' to both Muslims and Hindus alike. He appeared in a multitude form of deities (Lord Jesus, Guru Nanak Devji, Allah, Bhagwan Shri Ganesh) to cater to the various tastes of devotees. Sai was also fond of Nanavli, a mentally challenged devotee, who often challenged Sai, but was one of the few who really understood and accepted Sai as Vishnu's Avatar. Sai appeared simultaneously in a wealthy man's and Nana's dreams and called upon them to construct a Mandir of Bhagwan Shri Kishan. While the construction was under way, Sai prophesied the death of Tatya but also told them not to tell him and to not worry. Shortly thereafter while bequeathing the nine coins symbolizing nine virtues to Laxmi (which depict Sravan, Kirtan, Smaran, Pagsera, Archana, Namaskar, Dastan, Samveta, & Atmanivrdan) Sai was ready to demonstrate to his devotees why they should not worry about Tatya's impending demise.",Telgu
